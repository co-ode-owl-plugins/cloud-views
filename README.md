## Description
Wondering about the "shape" of your ontology? Several implementations of the popular TagCloud can give you insight into different aspects of your ontology - ratings are based on different criteria:

- usage
- depth in hierarchy
- restriction count (that is, how many anonymous superclasses a class has)
- descendant count
- sibling count
- interval rank (thanks to Julian Seidenberg)

The bigger the name, the higher the rating. Sort alphabetically or by rating, and filter out low ranking entities easily.

## Features
All entities are hyperlinked so this view can be used as a navigation tool
Tooltips show the rating of the entity under the cursor
Sort alphabetically or by importance
Exaggerate the importance of higher rated entities (zoom)
